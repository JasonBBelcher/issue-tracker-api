# Issue Tracker API

Api built for an Angular front end. Allows you to post issues that are seen globally but only you can edit your own issues. I built this demo to help me understand better how to write api's that call other api services. The Issue Tracker API calls the [JWT Authentication App](https://github.com/JasonBBelcher/jwt-user-authentication) in order to check if the user will be authenticated.
